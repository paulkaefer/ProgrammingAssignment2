## cachematrix.R
##
## Functions that create a matrix object with a cacheable inverse value.
## In other words, rather than having to re-compute the inverse every time it is needed,
##  the value is stored in the object.
##
## Forked from https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2 for the R Programming 
##  online course (https://class.coursera.org/rprog-011).
